## Personal setup

This is a personal repo to setup my dotfiles across different machines.

I'm using [**dotbot**](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to install the dotfiles.

### Installation

Just clone the repository and run `./install` inside the dotfiles directory to setup the dotfiles. If you have [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) installed and would like to use a fancier setup, clone the `powerline_supported` branch of this repo and then run the `./install` command inside that.

> Note: `dotbot` requires python and bash to be available. see [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for more info
